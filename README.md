hn-beautify
===========

A chrome extension that applies a stylesheet to Hacker News' frontpage and, in my opinion, makes reading it easier and more pleasant. [Click here to install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hn-beautify/nhgmoodfakokkkkkibmdaklneefimlag)

Alternatively you can install by cloning the repository and load the *dist* folder according to [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
